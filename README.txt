TomJan's Chess Improvment Tool (TCIT) is a Chess Improvement Tool. Currently Focused on Blindfold Chess Improvement. But will later be expanding to become a more general tool.

The following features are live:
* Totally Blindfold puzzles. The locations are printed out in the console, you will provide each move and if you get the answer correct, your rating increases and you will be served puzzles 
    more closely matching your rating. (puzzles taken from lichess database)
* Blindfold Knight movement. You are given two squares and must say how many turns it takes for a knight to go from one square to the other.
* Blindfold Bishop movement. You are given two squares and must say how many squares a bishop would need to cross to go from one square to the next.
